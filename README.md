### ReferCord
This is a Discord bot written with pycord to track user referrals.

## Features
> - [x] `/createinvite` - This will create an invite and assign it to you
> - [x] `/myinvite` - Responds with your invite
> - [x] `/inviter <@User>` - This will allow you to see who invited a mentioned user
> - [x] `/referraladd <amount> <user>` - Adds an amount of money to the mentioned user
> - [x] `/quickreferralAdd <amount> <user>` - Adds an amount of money to the referrer of the mentioned user
> - [x] `/referralamount [user]` - Responds with how much someone has referred

## Why ReferCord?
> - ReferCord was created because if a server has a vanity URL, that gets used as the default invite
> - E.G if I create an invite, it defaults to the vanity invite of the server, and if I specify an invite to be permanent and support unlimited joins, it'll go to the vanity.
> - Due to this, it can lead to other invite logging bots failing to register joins from people's invites as temporary invites are now mostly used.

## Issues
> - On vanity URL join, mucks up referral assignment
> - Code organisation
