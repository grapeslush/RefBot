# Discord Invite Tracker Bot

Thanks a ton to https://github.com/xzerios/ReferCord xzerios for the idea. I needed a way to track when people join a discord and how often they are doing it. I utilized his code as a starting point for the idea and built upon it.

## Features

- **Personal Invite Link Generation:** Allows users to create unique invite links to invite new members to the server.
- **Invite Tracking:** Tracks who invited whom, allowing for a fun and competitive way to see who can invite the most members.
- **Leaderboard:** Displays a leaderboard of top inviters, encouraging community engagement and growth.
- **Invite Balance Inquiry:** Lets users check their invite points to see how they rank in the community.
- **Inviter Information:** Enables new members to find out who invited them, fostering a welcoming environment.
